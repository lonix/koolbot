# KoolBot Commands Reference

Complete reference for every slash command KoolBot registers with Discord.

KoolBot's slash-command surface is intentionally small. All
**day-to-day chat interaction** stays in Discord (`/ping`, `/voicestats`,
`/seen`, `/quote`, `/achievements`, `/help`). All
**administration and configuration** lives in the Web UI, reached via the
single `/config` launcher.

> **Note:** Most commands must be enabled before they appear in Discord.
> Toggle them from the Web UI's **Settings** page (run `/config` to get a
> single-use sign-in link), then click **Reload commands to Discord** to
> push the registration change.

---

### `/quote`

**Description:** Add and manage memorable quotes in a dedicated bot-managed
channel. All quotes are posted in a channel where users can react with
👍/👎.

**Enable:** Web UI → Settings:

- `quotes.enabled = true`
- `quotes.channel_id = <channel-id>`
- (Optional) `quotes.cooldown`, `quotes.max_length`, `quotes.add_roles`,
  `quotes.delete_roles`

Then reload commands.

#### `/quote add`

Add a new quote.

**Usage:**

```text
/quote add text:"Great quote!" author:@Alice
```

**Parameters:**

- `text` (required) — The quote text
- `author` (required) — Who said it

**Example response:**

```text
✅ Quote added successfully and posted to the quote channel!
```

#### `/quote edit`

Edit an existing quote that you added.

**Usage:**

```text
/quote edit id:"697bdfe2808f7d245289392c" text:"Updated quote!"
/quote edit id:"697bdfe2808f7d245289392c" author:@Bob
/quote edit id:"697bdfe2808f7d245289392c" text:"New text" author:@Bob
```

**Parameters:**

- `id` (required) — Quote ID (in the quote footer)
- `text` (optional) — New quote text
- `author` (optional) — New author

**Notes:**

- You can only edit quotes that you added
- At least one of `text` or `author` must be provided

**How it works:**

1. User submits a quote via `/quote add`
2. Bot posts it as an embed in the configured quote channel
3. Bot adds 👍 / 👎 reactions
4. Users browse by scrolling the channel and vote with reactions
5. Bot cleans up unauthorized messages every few minutes

**Security:**

The bot configures the quote channel so that only the bot can post.
Users can read and react only. Unauthorized messages are removed by a
periodic cleanup job. A pinned header explains the channel's purpose
and is auto-recreated if deleted.

---

## 🔧 Admin: Web UI launcher

KoolBot has exactly one admin slash command. It does one thing: mint a
single-use sign-in link for the admin Web UI and DM it to you.

### `/config`

**Description:** Open the admin web UI. Sends you a single-use, time-limited
sign-in link via DM. Every administrative action — settings, permissions,
the setup wizard, announcements, polls, reaction roles, notices, voice
channel management, database cleanup, bot stats — happens in the Web UI.

**Permission:** Discord **Administrator** by default. `/config` is
registered with `setDefaultMemberPermissions(Administrator)`, so
Discord itself blocks non-administrators from invoking it before the
bot ever sees the interaction. To grant `/config` to non-admin roles,
override the command's permissions in Discord
(**Server Settings → Integrations → KoolBot → /config**); the Web UI's
Permissions page can only further restrict who is allowed once Discord
has admitted the interaction.

**Prerequisites:** Operator must have set `WEBUI_ENABLED=true`,
`WEBUI_BASE_URL`, and `WEBUI_SESSION_SECRET` in `.env` and restarted the
bot. See [WEBUI.md](WEBUI.md).

**Usage:**

```text
/config
```

No subcommands, no parameters.

**Behavior:**

1. Discord routes the interaction to the bot (it only does this for
   members the command's Discord-level permissions allow — Administrator
   by default; non-admin roles allowed only when an operator has added
   them via Server Settings → Integrations).
2. Bot revokes any prior unrevoked sessions you have.
3. Bot generates a single-use token bound to your Discord user ID
   (default TTL: 10 minutes; configurable via
   `WEBUI_SESSION_TTL_MINUTES`).
4. Bot DMs you a unique URL of the form
   `https://your-bot.example.com/admin/s/<token>`.
5. You open the link. The bot exchanges the token for a signed session
   cookie scoped to your user ID and redirects to `/admin/`.
6. You configure the bot in the Web UI. The session sliding window
   defaults to 30 minutes of inactivity and is hard-capped at the
   server-side TTL.
7. You end the session one of four ways:
   - Click **Finish** — server-side revoke + cookie cleared, immediate.
   - Re-run `/config` — server-side revoke of the prior session +
     fresh link minted.
   - Idle past the inactivity window or hard TTL — the next request
     rejects the cookie (the server-side row stays in MongoDB until
     it's TTL-expired or explicitly revoked).
   - Close the tab — the cookie sticks around in your browser and the
     session row stays valid in MongoDB until idle/TTL, so closing the
     tab is **not** equivalent to signing out. Click Finish if you want
     a hard end.

**Example responses:**

DM is delivered:

```text
✅ I've DMed you a single-use sign-in link. Check your direct messages.
```

DM is blocked (fallback to ephemeral reply, visible only to you):

```text
🔗 Koolbot admin sign-in link
https://bot.example.com/admin/s/9f4b...
This link is single-use and expires in about 10 minute(s).
If you did not run /config, ignore this message.
```

Web UI disabled:

```text
The web UI is disabled. Ask an operator to set WEBUI_ENABLED=true and restart the bot.
```

Missing required env vars:

```text
❌ Web UI is enabled but missing env vars: WEBUI_BASE_URL, WEBUI_SESSION_SECRET
```

**Why a launcher and not subcommands?**

The slash command surface is genuinely bad at editing long lists,
permission matrices, YAML, and structured configuration. The Web UI is
the right home for that. Keeping a single launcher means:

- No persistent OAuth setup for casual operators.
- The admin endpoint is dark unless an admin is actively configuring.
- A leaked link is useless after one redemption or after the TTL.
- Fat-fingering a setting has zero remediation cost — just close the tab.

## Voice Channel Control Panel

**Note:** This is not a slash command. It is the inline component-based
panel posted in a dynamically created voice channel's text chat.

**Description:** When you create a voice channel (by joining the lobby),
an interactive control panel is automatically sent to the channel's text
chat. Only you (the channel owner) can use it.

**Enable:** Web UI → Settings → `voicechannels.controlpanel.enabled = true`
(default: `true`).

**Buttons (row 1):**

- **✏️ Rename** — Rename your channel (modal)
- **🔒 Make Private / 🌐 Make Public** — Toggle privacy mode
- **👥 Invite** — Invite a user to your private channel
- **👑 Transfer** — Transfer ownership to another user in the channel

**Buttons (row 2):**

- **🔴 Go Live / ⬜ Go Offline** — Mark the channel as live with a streaming disclaimer
- **⏳ Waiting Room / 🗑️ Remove Waiting Room** — Toggle a companion waiting room

**Features:**

- Posted into the voice channel's text chat — visible to everyone with
  access to that channel; only the channel owner can interact with the
  buttons (non-owners get an ephemeral "Only the channel owner can use
  these controls" reply if they click)
- Updates dynamically as privacy / live / waiting-room state changes
- Persists until the channel is deleted
- Posted automatically every time a new channel is created

**Requirements:**

- Discord server must support text channels associated with voice channels
- `voicechannels.controlpanel.enabled` must be `true`

**Example panel:**

```text
🎮 Voice Channel Controls

Manage your voice channel: **Your Channel Name**

Privacy: 🌐 Public
🔴 LIVE

[✏️ Rename] [🔒 Make Private] [👥 Invite] [👑 Transfer]
[⬜ Go Offline] [🗑️ Remove Waiting Room]

Only the channel owner can use these controls
```

### Rename channel

Click **✏️ Rename** to open a modal where you can enter a new name. No
placeholder requirements — use any name.

### Toggle privacy

**🔒 Make Private** restricts the channel to you and invited users. **🌐
Make Public** opens it back up.

### Invite users

While the channel is private, click **👥 Invite**. The bot replies with
an ephemeral message explaining how to grant a user access:
right-click their name in Discord and **Edit Channel Permissions** for
this channel. (The button is intentionally an instructions handoff, not
an interactive user picker — Discord's per-user channel permission
panel covers the actual grant.)

### Transfer ownership

**👑 Transfer** opens a dropdown of users currently in the channel.
Pick one to hand over ownership instantly.

### Go Live

**🔴 Go Live** adds a `🔴` prefix to your channel name, posts a Terms-of-
Service disclaimer in the channel text chat, and notifies anyone joining
that the channel is live. **⬜ Go Offline** removes the prefix and
indicator.

### Waiting Room

**⏳ Waiting Room** creates a companion waiting-room channel. Joiners
land there muted; you (the owner) get a notification with a **🚪 Let In**
button to admit them. **🗑️ Remove Waiting Room** deletes it.

## 🔒 Permission Requirements

### User command permissions

| Command         | Permission Level | Additional Requirements                    |
| --------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `/ping`         | Everyone\*       | Command must be enabled                    |
| `/voicestats`   | Everyone\*       | Voice tracking enabled                     |
| `/achievements` | Everyone\*       | Achievements enabled                       |
| `/seen`         | Everyone\*       | Voice tracking + seen enabled              |
| `/quote`        | Everyone\*       | Quotes enabled                             |

\* Per-command role gating can be added in the Web UI's **Permissions** page.

### Admin command permissions

| Command   | Permission                                                                                                     |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/config` | Administrator (Discord-level default; to widen to non-admin roles, override in Server Settings → Integrations) |

The Web UI's Permissions page can only **further restrict** who is
allowed to use `/config` once Discord has admitted the interaction. It
cannot widen access past Discord's `setDefaultMemberPermissions(Administrator)`
gate.

### Bot permissions required

The bot needs these Discord permissions:

**Essential:**

- Read Messages / View Channels
- Send Messages
- Use Slash Commands
- Embed Links
- Attach Files

**For voice features:**

- Manage Channels (create/delete voice channels)
- Move Members (move users to created channels)
- View Channel (see voice channels)
- Connect (for voice state updates)

**For reaction roles:**

- Manage Roles (the bot's highest role must sit above any role it grants)

**For leaderboard role rewards:**

- Manage Roles (same hierarchy rule as above)

## 🎯 Common Workflows

### Initial bot setup

1. Run `/config` in Discord.
2. Open the DM'd link.
3. Click **Setup Wizard** in the navigation.
4. Pick the features you want (voice channels, voice tracking, quotes,
   achievements, logging, etc.). The wizard auto-detects existing
   channels and applies the related settings for you.
5. On the **Settings** page, hit **Reload commands to Discord** if the
   wizard enabled any commands that should now appear in Discord.

### Enable a single command

1. `/config` → open the Web UI.
2. **Settings** → find `<command>.enabled`, set to `true`, save.
3. Click **Reload commands to Discord**.
4. Wait a minute or two for Discord to sync.

### Manage permissions

1. `/config` → open the Web UI.
2. **Permissions** → pick a command, pick the roles allowed to use it.
3. Save. Changes take effect immediately.

### Schedule an announcement

1. `/config` → open the Web UI.
2. **Announcements** → New announcement.
3. Pick a channel, a cron schedule (`0 9 * * *` = daily 9 AM), the
   message, and optional embed fields.
4. Save. The announcement persists across bot restarts.

### Trigger weekly voice stats now

1. `/config` → open the Web UI.
2. **Announcements** → click **Post weekly stats now**.

### Manual database cleanup

1. `/config` → open the Web UI.
2. **Database** → click **Run cleanup now**.

### Backup and restore configuration

- **Settings** page → **Export** to download a YAML file.
- **Settings** page → **Import** to upload YAML; preview the diff before
  apply. Bootstrap env vars are excluded from both directions.

### Reset a single setting

- **Settings** page → find the key → click **Reset to default**.

### Troubleshooting commands not appearing

1. Web UI → **Settings** → verify `<command>.enabled = true`.
2. Click **Reload commands to Discord**.
3. Wait 2-5 minutes for Discord to sync.

---

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### "Command not found" or command doesn't appear

1. Web UI → **Settings** → check `<command>.enabled`.
2. Set it to `true` if needed, save.
3. **Reload commands to Discord** (required).
4. Wait 2-5 minutes.

### "Permission denied" errors

- Do you have Administrator permission (for `/config`)?
- Is the bot's role high enough in the Discord role hierarchy?
- Is the feature enabled in the Web UI's Settings page?
- For `/config`: is `WEBUI_ENABLED=true` and are the other `WEBUI_*`
  env vars set? Check the bot logs for `WebUI mounted at /admin`.

### Voice commands not working

Web UI → **Settings** → verify both:

- `voicechannels.enabled = true`
- `voicetracking.enabled = true`

Then click **Reload commands to Discord**.

### Stats showing as empty

- Tracking might have been enabled recently (give it time).
- Channels you care about might be in `voicetracking.excluded_channels`.
- Users have to actually have been in voice channels since tracking
  started.

Verify excluded channels on the Settings page.

### Magic link doesn't arrive

- DMs from server members might be disabled. The bot falls back to an
  ephemeral reply in the channel where you ran `/config` — check there.
- The bot might not have permission to DM you for other reasons. Run
  `/config` again and look at the channel reply.

### Magic link 404s when clicked

- Already used (single-use).
- Expired (default 10 minutes).
- Superseded by a newer `/config` invocation.

Run `/config` again.
